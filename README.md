RECOMMENDATION.
Leverage Seasonal Trends
Observation: Sales peak significantly during the summer months, particularly in August.
Recommendation: Capitalize on this trend by launching targeted marketing campaigns, discounts, or promotions during the summer season to further boost sales. Additionally, consider increasing inventory levels for high-demand products like Men's Athletic Footwear during these months to avoid stockouts.
2. Focus on High-Performing States
Observation: California and New York contribute disproportionately to overall revenue.

3. Optimize Product Mix
Observation: Men's Athletic Footwear is a top-performing category.
Recommendation: Expand the range of athletic footwear options while ensuring competitive pricing and quality. Additionally, cross-sell complementary products (e.g., sportswear or accessories) to increase average order value. Monitor emerging trends in consumer preferences to stay ahead of the competition.
4. Enhance Regional Strategies
Observation: The West Coast and Northeast regions dominate sales.
Recommendation: Develop region-specific strategies to address unique customer needs and preferences. For example, focus on outdoor gear in mountainous regions or casual wear in warmer climates. Also, consider expanding physical store locations or e-commerce logistics in these high-performing regions.
5. Strengthen Retailer Partnerships
